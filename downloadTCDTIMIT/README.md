Hi, 
This file explains how to use scripts in this folder in order to download the TCDTIMIT dataset

- **download_tcd_timit.py** script downloads the dataset outside the repo into TCDTIMITDataset folder. The links of all the files to be downloaded are stored in `downloadLocations.txt`  
- You need to request an account and login to the sigmedia website (https://sigmedia.tcd.ie/TCDTIMIT/) first. More instructions inside the script.  
- Then you can use the **unzipStructure.py** script to unzip all of the zip files.
